            The inherent structure of human cognition facilitates the hierarchical organization of semantic categories for
            three-dimensional objects, simplifying the visual world into distinct and manageable layers. A vivid example is
            observed in the animal-taxonomy domain, where distinctions are not only made between broader categories like
            birds and mammals but also within subcategories such as different bird species, illustrating the depth of human
            hierarchical processing. This paper presents Deep Hierarchical Learning (DHL) on 3D data, a framework that,
            by formulating a probabilistic representation of hierarchical learning, lays down a pioneering theoretical foundation for hierarchical learning (HL) in 3D vision tasks. On this groundwork, we technically solve three primary
            challenges: 1) To effectively connect hierarchical coherence with classification loss, we introduce a hierarchical
            regularization term, utilizing an aggregation matrix from the forecasting field. 2) To align point-wise embeddings
            with hierarchical relationships, we develop the Hierarchical Embedding Fusion Module (HEFM) as a plug-in
            module in 3D deep learning, catalyzing enhanced hierarchical embedding learning. 3) To tackle the universality
            issue within DHL, we devise a novel method for constructing class hierarchies in common datasets with flattened
            fine-grained labels, employing large vision language models. The above approaches ensure the effectiveness of
            DHL in processing 3D data across multiple hierarchical levels. Through extensive experiments on three public
            datasets, the validity of our methodology is demonstrated. The source code will be released publicly, promoting
            further investigation and development in hierarchical learning.

            This architecture takes the raw point cloud
            as input and facilitates the learning of hierarchically coherent
            predictions. It consists of three key components:
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc!important; margin-top: 10px">
                <li>
                    <b>Encoder and Multi-Decoders (EMD):</b> The EMD is a
                    multi-task learning network that incorporates a shared
                    encoder and multiple parallel decoders, with each decoder
                    corresponding to a hierarchical layer. In Section V, we explore the use of three popular 3D segmentation backbones
                    as encoders, including PointNet++, RandLANet,
                    and SparseUNet. The EMD focuses on encoding geometric information while disregarding the rich semantic
                    relations among classes at different hierarchical layers
                    simultaneously.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <b>Hierarchical Embedding Fusion Module (HEFM):</b>
                    The HEFM leverages structured knowledge (i.e., TDCC
                    and BDCC) to reshape point embeddings, generating
                    hierarchy-aware point representations and enhancing coherence in predictions
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <b>Hierarchical Coherence (HC) Loss:</b> Our proposed network is trained end-to-end by minimizing a combination
                    of the HC loss and cross-entropy loss.

            </ul>

            The TDCC and BDCC constraints outline the necessary conditions for hierarchically coherent predictions.
            We contemplate employing them BDCC as
            constraints for HL. However, direct utilization of TDCC and
            BDCC is challenging and redundant for the loss in Section 4.3.
            We consider adapting them into soft constraints for multiple
            samples, i.e., inter-points constraints. The specific expression
            of this adaptation is that if two points have inconsistent
            predictions at the super-class layer, their predictions at the
            sub-class layer must be inconsistent as well; if their predictions
            at the sub-class layer are consistent, then their predictions at
            the super-class layer must also be consistent. These constraints
            are integrated into the Hierarchical Embedding Fusion Module
            (HEFM). The HEFM comprises two essential components:
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc !important; margin-top: 10px">
            <li>
                <b>Top-aware Fusion:</b> It ensures that points associated with
                the same super-class labels in the top-level should be
                proximate to each other within the embedding space of
                the bottom-level.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Bottom-guided Aggregation:</b> It enforces that points
                linked to the same subclass labels in the bottom-level
                should exhibit similarity within the top-level embedding
                space.

            The preceding sections detailed a method for training segmentation models on hierarchically annotated 3D datasets. Yet,
            the significant annotation effort required for such datasets often
            limits their availability. To broaden our approach’s
            applicability, we introduce a technique to construct a class
            hierarchy from the fine-grained class labels within the dataset.
            Our methodology exploits a Vision Language Model (VLM)
            to derive class embeddings. Subsequently, these embeddings
            inform a hierarchical clustering process, producing a dendrogram of classes. It’s essential to underscore that constructing
            a label taxonomy for hierarchical 3D segmentation should
            account for both the semantic relevance and the geometric
            characteristics of the class. Recent advances in VLMs, particularly in aligning geometric features in images with language
            embeddings, enable us to harness pre-trained embeddings for
            this hierarchy extraction. We utilized the widely-acknowledged
            CLIP text encoder, trained on the WebImage Text Dataset,
            to encode the fine-grained classes present in the 3D dataset.
            For improved precision, we employed the dataset’s class
            definitions as caption text, rather than solely the class terms,
            thus mitigating potential word embedding ambiguities. These
            embeddings then serve as features, guiding the iterative merging of clusters from the original fine-grained classes into a
            class dendrogram. Ultimately, we employ a large language
            model (LLM) to prune the generated dendrogram, resulting
            in a semantically coherent class hierarchy. This entire process
            is depicted in Fig

            Across nearly all hierarchical levels and models, we observe
            consistent performance gains when employing HL. The sole
            deviation from this trend is with the multi-classifier variant
            of PointNet++ (i.e., PointNet++ without HL), which outperforms its HL counterpart at the most coarse-grained level.
            A potential explanation for this could be that the inherent
            structure and feature representation of the raw PointNet++
            model is better suited for coarse-grained segmentation tasks,
            whereas HL might introduce complexities that marginally
            diminish performance at that specific level. Nevertheless, the
            overall superior performance of the HL mechanism over
            the traditional multi-classifier underscores its potency in 3D
            hierarchical semantic segmentation. A potential explanation
            for the HL method’s enhanced performance is that the intrinsic
            relationships among hierarchical label layers may provide
            supplementary geometric information beneficial for semantic
            segmentation

            Results for the three models, both with and without HL, can be found in Tables 3 through 5. The mIoU
            has been computed for each of the 17 part categories
            as well as the average across three levels of segmenta-
            tion: coarse-, middle-, and fine-grained. From the data
            in Tables 3 to 5, it’s evident that SparseUNet, Rand-
            LANet, and PointNet++ models equipped with HL
            outperform their non-HL counterparts in 12, 13, and
            12 categories, respectively, in terms of mIoU. Additionally, HL has been shown to improve the average
            mIoU across all 17 categories by approximately 1%
            to 2%, further underscoring the benefits of its integration. Significant observations include: 1) the class
            categories that have shown improvement with HL
            vary considerably among different backbone models,
            such as SparseUNet, RandLANet, and PointNet++,
            and 2) there are certain categories where HL did not
            enhance performance. These variations suggest that
            HL’s effectiveness is not uniform across all categories
            and may be influenced by the inherent characteristics of the backbone models. This variability indicates
            a good generalization capability of HL, as different
            models, with their unique strengths and weaknesses,
            may inherently perform well or poorly on certain class
            categories.

            In this subsection, we evaluate the proposed HL
            approach on another 3D dataset, SensatUrban (Hu
            et al, 2021). This dataset is not originally annotated in
            a hierarchical manner. To create a hierarchical structure, we employ our class hierarchy mining method
            (refer to Sec. 4.4), generating a two-level class hierarchy, which is displayed by Fig. 7. The enhanced
            dataset, which we denote as “SensatUrban-H”, will be
            publicly available once the paper is accepted.
            Semantic segmentation results for SensatUrban-
            H are presented in Table 6. Aside from the OA of
            SparseUNet at the coarse-grained level, HL has led to
            significant improvements. Most notably, in the finegrained (level 2) segmentation task, HL boosts the
            performance of RandLANet by over 15% in terms of
            mIoU and around 9% in terms of OA.
